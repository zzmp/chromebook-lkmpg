Before compiling your own kernel modules,
you will need to have a kernel compiled from source
from which to draw config/headers.

On a Samsung 2 (Intel) chromebook, this can be done with:

    cd chrubuntu-kernel
    sudo ./update.sh 3.10.18

This will add a symlinked `/lib/modules/build` folder to
a made chromeos kernel.
